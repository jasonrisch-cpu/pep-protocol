# DESIGN PRINCIPLES — PEP System

## Structural Invariants for Coherence-Preserving Exchange

This document defines the non-negotiable design principles that govern the
Personal Exchange Protocol (PEP).

These principles exist to prevent drift into:

- coercion
- identity capture
- moralization
- bureaucratic rigidity
- optimization pathology
- ideological misuse

They are not preferences.
They are structural constraints derived from observed failure modes in
economic, social, and psychological systems.

Any future extension of PEP must preserve these invariants.

If a change violates them, the change is invalid.

---

## 1. Coherence Before Optimization

PEP prioritizes system coherence over numerical maximization.

Optimization maximizes one variable.
Coherence minimizes destructive interference.

A system that optimizes price, profit, or efficiency at the expense of
regulation will destabilize.

Therefore:

- Stability > Speed
- Integrity > Growth
- Continuity > Extraction

No feature may be introduced that sacrifices coherence for performance.

---

## 2. Fear Is Treated as Noise

Fear is a known distortion in valuation systems.

Scarcity anxiety, status anxiety, and survival pressure corrupt price signals.

PEP treats fear as informational noise, not motivation.

Design implication:

- Baseline sustainability is protected
- Floor violations are diagnostic signals
- Pricing under panic is invalid data

No mechanism may be introduced that relies on fear to function.

---

## 3. Identity Must Remain Decoupled From Price

In PEP, price is a signal, not a verdict.

Self-worth, dignity, and belonging must never depend on transaction outcomes.

Design implication:

- No reputation scoring
- No prestige multipliers
- No punishment for refusal
- No reward for overpricing

Any system that fuses identity with pricing will eventually produce coercion.

---

## 4. Exit Is a Core Safety Mechanism

Any role, exchange, or participation mode must remain voluntarily reversible.

Trapped agents become distorted agents.

Design implication:

- No lock-in
- No penalty for disengagement
- No dependency creation
- No retaliation for refusal

If exit is costly, the design has failed.

---

## 5. Authority Must Dissolve Automatically

No component of PEP grants permanent authority.

Any guidance, role, or coordination function must dissolve when its purpose ends.

Design implication:

- No standing enforcers
- No permanent administrators
- No credential capture
- No institutional inertia

Authority is a temporary compression of latency, not a status.

---

## 6. Prices Must Carry Information, Not Power

Pricing exists to transmit system state, not dominance.

When prices become tools of leverage, signaling collapses.

Design implication:

- No monopoly amplification
- No scarcity manipulation
- No artificial opacity
- No hidden extraction

Clean prices reflect constraints.
Dirty prices reflect power.

PEP is built for clean pricing.

---

## 7. Human Regulation Is Primary

PEP is a regulation training system first, an economic system second.

All protocols are designed to strengthen:

- latency
- refusal
- calibration
- feedback integration
- somatic awareness

Economic accuracy is secondary to regulatory integrity.

If psychological regulation degrades, the system is failing.

---

## 8. Instrumentation Serves Orientation, Not Control

Data exists to support awareness and learning.

It does not exist to enforce compliance.

Design implication:

- No surveillance-based enforcement
- No behavioral scoring
- No automated punishment
- No hidden profiling

Instrumentation may inform.
It may never dominate.

---

## 9. Scaling Must Preserve Local Coherence

PEP scales through nested coherence, not centralization.

Each layer must remain intelligible and governable at human scale.

Design implication:

- No bypass of local context
- No global overrides
- No abstracted governance
- No remote coercion

All large systems must remain decomposable.

---

## 10. Failure Must Remain Visible

PEP treats failure as system data, not moral defect.

Concealment of failure produces pathology.

Design implication:

- No shame mechanisms
- No punishment loops
- No reputation erasure
- No historical stigmatization

Errors are surfaced, integrated, and released.

---

## 11. Substrate Neutrality

PEP must function across:

- market systems
- cooperative systems
- gift economies
- hybrid models
- emerging AI-mediated systems

It may not require ideological alignment.

Only functional coherence is required.

---

## 12. No Hidden Metaphysics

PEP makes no ontological, spiritual, or religious claims.

Any symbolic language is pedagogical, not doctrinal.

Design implication:

- No belief tests
- No worldview enforcement
- No metaphysical authority
- No sacred narratives

The system must work for skeptics.

---

## 13. Minimal Sufficiency Principle

PEP avoids unnecessary complexity.

Every mechanism must justify its existence.

Design implication:

- No ornamental features
- No prestige layers
- No decorative metrics
- No unused abstractions

If something is not load-bearing, it should be removed.

---

## 14. Voluntary Adoption Only

PEP must never require compulsion to function.

If adoption requires force, the design is invalid.

Design implication:

- No mandatory participation
- No default enrollment
- No coercive incentives
- No hidden penalties

The system must survive by attraction.

---

## 15. Long-Horizon Stability

All design decisions must be evaluated on multi-decade horizons.

Short-term gains that undermine long-term trust are prohibited.

Design implication:

- No extractive shortcuts
- No speculative bubbles
- No short-term manipulation
- No narrative inflation

Trust is the primary capital.

---

## Summary Invariant

PEP exists to preserve:

- agency
- dignity
- coherence
- voluntary exchange
- long-term trust

Any feature that undermines these violates the system.

---

## Maintainer Responsibility

Anyone modifying PEP assumes responsibility for preserving these invariants.

If future contributors disagree with these principles,
they are building a different system.

They should fork.
