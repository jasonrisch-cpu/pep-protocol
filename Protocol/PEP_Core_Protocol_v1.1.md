Scope: Individual → Dyad → Small Group
Non-Goals: Market domination, optimization, ideology

0. Reader Orientation

This document specifies a cybernetic protocol for value exchange.

PEP is:

not a pricing hack

not a moral theory

not a market ideology

not a substitute for survival action


PEP is:

a regulation system for money, time, and effort

a method for breaking pricing paralysis

a training protocol for sovereignty and identity decoupling

substrate-neutral (works inside capitalism, cooperatives, barter, gift contexts)


Primary function:

> Preserve internal coherence while participating in external exchange.



Pricing accuracy is secondary.
System stability is primary.


---

1. Core Invariant

> Exchange must not generate internal load that destabilizes the agent.



If an exchange produces:

resentment

collapse

shame

inflationary ego

freeze or avoidance


…it is mispriced, regardless of market acceptance.


---

2. Definitions

2.1 Cost (C)

C is the true unit cost of producing the exchangeable output.

C must be honest, not inflated and not minimized.

C may include:

materials

consumables

tools (amortized)

energy

space

system maintenance

time (mode-dependent)


Hiding costs from yourself = self-extraction.


---

2.2 Operating Modes (Critical)

PEP operates in three explicit modes.

Mode A — Unit Cost (Product-Based)

Use when:

selling discrete items

pricing becomes unmarketable if time is included

work is side-income or supplemental


C includes: materials, tools, energy
C excludes: living expenses, time

Examples: crafts, patches, garments, goods


---

Mode B — Hourly Cost (Time-Based)

Use when:

time is the product

work is primary income

services are continuous


C includes: life maintenance prorated by billable hours

Formula example:
Monthly costs ÷ billable hours = hourly C

Examples: consulting, caregiving, coaching


---

Mode C — Hybrid (Job-Based)

Use when:

work mixes time + output

tasks vary unpredictably

contracts or loads are discrete


C is constructed per job.

Examples: trucking, contracting, repair, installation


---

Mode selection is a calibration choice.
Mode-switching is allowed if it reduces distortion.

Mode-switching to avoid discomfort = misuse.


---

3. Cost Prorating Rules

3.1 Life Maintenance

Optional in Mode A if income is supplemental

Required in Mode B if income is primary

Partial in Mode C depending on job share


Use honest denominator:

billable hours

expected output volume

contract scope



---

3.2 Learning & Skill Development

Two categories:

One-time learning:
Amortize across expected production.

Ongoing development:
Treat as system maintenance, not per-item cost.

If unsure: exclude initially and reassess after market feedback.


---

3.3 Necessity vs Inflation Check

Ask:

Does this cost prevent failure?

Does it reduce friction or just increase comfort?

Would removing it collapse quality or identity?


If cost exists primarily to justify higher pricing → inflation warning.


---

4. The Pricing Envelope (3-6-12)

PEP defines price as a bounded field, not a point.

Let C = true cost.

Floor (3C) — Sustainability boundary

Center (6C) — Resonant fair exchange

Ceiling (12C) — Integrity warning threshold


These values are heuristic anchors, not laws.

They emerged from somatic calibration (±10 method), not theory.

They must be tested and tuned per context.


---

5. The ±10 Calibration Protocol (Required)

This is the heart of PEP.

Procedure:

1. Set price at Floor (3C)
Observe body, breath, affect.


2. Set price at Ceiling (12C)
Observe tension, justification, inflation.


3. Sweep between extremes.


4. Find the neutral center:

no contraction

no performative confidence

no need to explain




This is proprioceptive training for value exchange.

Repeated calibration increases accuracy and speed.


---

6. The 51/49 Symmetry Break

Used only when paralysis persists.

Steps:

1. Acknowledge doubt (not failure).


2. SBR: Stare → Breathe → Relax.


3. Assign one option 51%.


4. Execute.


5. Log outcome.



If 3+ consecutive regretful outcomes occur:

pause

reassess C, mode, or calibration process



---

7. Negotiation Protocol

7.1 Holding the Floor

Never negotiate below floor.

Do not justify.

Offer scope changes instead of price cuts.


If counter < floor → clean exit.


---

7.2 Immediate Acceptance Signal

If ceiling is accepted instantly:

log as potential underpricing

do not retroactively change price

recalibrate next iteration



---

7.3 Clean Exit Script

> “I can’t do this at that rate.
If circumstances change, I’m open.”



No apology. No explanation.


---

8. Context Modulation

Trust Assessment Signals

High-Trust:

repeated reciprocity

voluntary generosity

no entitlement language


Low-Trust:

anonymity

leverage pressure

urgency manipulation


Community ≠ high trust by default.

High-trust discounts are gifts, not obligations.


---

Non-Monetary Exchange

Barter, sliding scale, and gifts are valid if:

C is acknowledged

floor is respected internally

resentment does not accrue


Sliding scale must remain within envelope.


---

9. Market Feedback Diagnostics

If floor rejected 5+ times:

1. Audit C


2. Audit audience


3. Audit framing


4. Consider exit or subsidy



PEP does not obligate unviable work.


---

10. Ceiling Overshoot Handling

Ceiling crossing is a signal, not a sin.

Legitimate contexts:

extreme scarcity

crisis response

monopoly skill (temporarily)


Warning signs:

defensiveness

status performance

fear of competition


Recovery protocol:

acknowledge

recalibrate

adjust future pricing

repair relationships if needed



---

11. Failure Modes (Named)

Weaponized PEP — using protocol to shame others

Envelope Worship — refusing adaptation

Community Extraction — coerced “mates’ rates”

Ceiling Chasing — treating 12C as target

Doubt Denial — paralysis masked as rigor


Correction: return to calibration.


---

12. Identity & Function (Resolved)

Primary function:
Sovereignty training via exchange.

Secondary effect:
Improved pricing accuracy.

If these conflict, sovereignty wins.


---

13. Ecosystem Compatibility

PEP works in:

capitalist markets

cooperatives

gift economies

barter systems


PEP fails in:

coercive environments

survival crises

opaque power structures



---

14. Summary Constraint

> Do not seek the “right” price.
Seek the clean price.



A clean price:

keeps you online

preserves dignity

allows learning

does not require self-betrayal
