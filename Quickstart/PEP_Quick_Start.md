Presence–Exchange–Pricing

A 10-Minute Guide to Clean Pricing Without Self-Betrayal

Version: 1.1
Status: Operational

What This Is

PEP is a simple system to help you:

stop undercharging

stop overcharging

stop freezing

stop tying your worth to money

price things cleanly

negotiate without stress


You don’t need business training.
You don’t need confidence.

You need a method.

This is the method.


---

Step 1 — Find Your True Cost (C)

Before pricing anything, find C = what it actually costs you.

Include:

☐ materials
☐ tools/software
☐ utilities
☐ packaging/shipping
☐ basic overhead
☐ learning time (if relevant)

If this is your main income, also include:

☐ housing
☐ food
☐ healthcare
☐ rest

If it’s a side project, you can skip life costs.

Be honest.
Hiding costs = self-extraction.


---

Step 2 — Pick Your Cost Mode

Choose one:

A. Per Item (most crafts, products)

C = materials + overhead

B. Per Hour (services, care, consulting)

C = (monthly expenses ÷ billable hours)

C. Per Job (mixed work)

Combine A + B

Don’t overthink this.
You can change later.


---

Step 3 — Build Your Price Range

Multiply C:

Floor   = 3 × C   (minimum safe)
Center  = 6 × C   (normal fair)
Ceiling = 12 × C  (high-load limit)

This is your envelope.

Never go below Floor. Don’t aim for Ceiling.


---

Step 4 — Calibrate With Your Body (30 Seconds)

Close your eyes.

Imagine charging:

• Floor → notice your body
• Ceiling → notice your body

Now find the price that feels:

✔ steady
✔ not apologetic
✔ not aggressive

That’s your Center today.


---

Step 5 — Choose Based on Context

Ask:

Is this:

☐ a stranger? → aim near Center
☐ a repeat client? → lower-middle
☐ a friend/community? → lower range
☐ urgent/scarce? → higher range

Pick accordingly.


---

Step 6 — If You’re Stuck: Use 51/49

If you can’t decide:

1. Pause.


2. Breathe.


3. Pick one option (51%).


4. Send it.


5. Learn.



Don’t wait for certainty. Certainty comes after action.


---

Step 7 — Hold Your Floor in Negotiation

If someone counters low:

> “I can’t do it at that level.
I can adjust the scope.”



Never apologize for your floor.

If no agreement: Walk cleanly.


---

Step 8 — Read the Feedback

After each exchange, ask:

Did I feel: ☐ calm after? ☐ resentful? ☐ ashamed? ☐ inflated?

Patterns matter.

One weird sale = noise.
Five bad ones = recalibrate.


---

Emergency Rule

If you are in real survival crisis:

Break the floor if needed. Survive first. Rebuild later.

No shame.


---

Common Traps (Avoid These)

✘ “I’ll charge less so they like me.”
✘ “PEP says I must charge X.”
✘ “I’ll make it up in volume.”
✘ “They’re my community, I owe them.”
✘ “More money means I’m winning.”

All are identity traps.

Return to calibration.


---

One-Sentence Rule

> Don’t seek the “right” price.
Seek the clean price.



Clean = keeps you stable + honest.


---

If You Remember Only Three Things

1. Know your real cost.


2. Stay above 3×C.


3. Don’t fuse with outcomes.



Everything else is refinement.


---

Why This Works

PEP works because:

it bounds fear

it trains judgment

it restores agency

it keeps you online


It’s not about being rich.

It’s about being free to work without hurting yourself.
