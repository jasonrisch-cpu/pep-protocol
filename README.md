PEP — Personal Exchange Protocol

PEP is a practical protocol for pricing, negotiation, and value exchange that preserves internal coherence while operating inside real economic systems.

It was developed from lived practice (starting with pricing handmade work) and generalized into a cybernetic regulation system for money, time, and effort.

PEP is not an ideology.
It does not replace markets, contracts, or law.
It is a self-regulation layer for humans participating in exchange.

What PEP Solves

PEP addresses three common failure modes in exchange:

Pricing paralysis (“I don’t know what to charge”)

Identity fusion (self-worth tied to acceptance or rejection)

Self-extraction (underpricing that generates resentment or collapse)


It does this by treating price as a bounded field, not a single number, and by training the nervous system to remain regulated under negotiation.

Core Principle

> An exchange is invalid if it destabilizes the person making it.



Market acceptance alone is not a sufficient success metric.
Internal coherence matters.

Core Documents

PEP Core Protocol v1.1
The canonical specification: operating modes, cost calculation, pricing envelope, calibration, negotiation, and diagnostics.

PEP Quick Start
A compressed, 2-page operational guide.

Worked Examples Pack
Concrete examples across scales:

individual artisan

hourly service work

dyadic negotiation

small group / cell exchange

emergency override scenarios



Design Orientation

PEP is designed to scale:

Individual — personal pricing, boundaries, sovereignty

Dyad — clean negotiation without coercion

Small Group / Cell — fair internal exchange

Larger Systems — compatible with cooperative, market, or mixed economies


PEP does not require:

belief in any metaphysical claims

spiritual language

a specific political or economic system


It works wherever humans exchange value.


---

What PEP Is Not

PEP is not:

a pricing formula that guarantees profit

a value-based pricing ideology

a moral judgment on markets

a survival strategy in true emergencies

a way to force others to behave “fairly”


PEP governs your side of the exchange.


---

Intended Use

PEP is for:

artisans, makers, freelancers

caregivers and service workers

consultants and contractors

cooperatives and small teams

anyone learning to price without self-betrayal


PEP is especially useful where:

work quality is high but confidence is unstable

markets are noisy or ambiguous

“mates’ rates” or community pressure distort exchange



---

Status

Version: v1.1

Maturity: Field-tested, actively refined

Stability: Core invariants stable; examples and tooling evolving

> PEP is a bounded-range pricing and negotiation protocol that uses cost honesty, somatic calibration, and feedback loops to prevent identity fusion and self-extraction in economic exchange.
