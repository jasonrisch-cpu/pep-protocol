# pep-protocol
PEP (Personal Exchange Protocol) is a practical system for fair pricing, identity-decoupled exchange, and nervous-system regulation in economic interactions. It provides cost-based envelopes, calibration methods, and feedback tools to support sustainable work, clean negotiation, and long-term personal and social coherence.
