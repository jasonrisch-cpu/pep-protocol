PEP Glossary

Personal Exchange Protocol — Core Terms

This glossary defines operational meanings used throughout the PEP system.
All terms are functional, not ideological.


---

A

Alignment (PEP)

The reduction of destructive interference between:

values

actions

prices

nervous system state
Not agreement. Not obedience. Functional coherence.



---

B

Baseline (Metabolic Baseline)

The minimum material stability required to maintain orientation:

shelter

food

rest

health

safety


PEP assumes baseline is protected externally when possible.
When it is not, it must be embedded in pricing.


---

Boundary

A non-negotiable constraint protecting system viability. Example: “I do not work below 3C.”

Boundaries preserve coherence.


---

C

C (True Cost)

The honest, complete cost of producing a unit of work.

May include:

materials

tools

energy

maintenance

amortized learning

optional life costs (depending on mode)


Hiding costs from yourself = self-extraction.


---

Calibration

The process of tuning internal and external signals to find stable exchange values.

Uses:

±10 method

somatic feedback

market feedback

iteration



---

Ceiling (Pmax)

Upper integrity limit of pricing envelope (default ≈12C).

Beyond this:

distortion increases

identity fusion risk rises

extractive dynamics appear


Ceiling is a warning zone, not a target.


---

Clean Price

A price that:

sustains the maker

clears the market

produces no internal strain


Not “optimal.”
Not “maximal.”
Clean.


---

Coherence

Low interference between system components.

In PEP:

financial

emotional

relational

cognitive


Primary design goal.


---

D

Doubt Hindrance

Decision paralysis caused by excessive option analysis.

Resolved via:

SBR

51/49

execution + feedback



---

E

Envelope (Price Envelope)

Bounded price range:

[ Floor – Center – Ceiling ]

Default: 3C – 6C – 12C

Provides freedom without collapse.


---

Extraction

Value removal that destabilizes the producer.

Occurs when pricing < sustainable cost.


---

F

Floor (Pmin)

Lower survival threshold (default ≈3C).

Below this:

system drains

burnout risk rises

resentment accumulates


Repeated floor violations = unsustainable.


---

Feedback Loop

Cycle of: Action → Result → Adjustment

PEP is built on continuous feedback.


---

G

Gain (Control Theory)

Intensity of internal drive applied to action.

High gain → rigidity
Low gain → flexibility

PEP reduces gain distortion in pricing.


---

H

High-Trust Context

Exchange environment with:

reciprocity

accountability

transparency

low manipulation


Enables lower envelope usage.


---

Hybrid Mode

Pricing based on combined time + unit + job factors.

Used in:

trucking

contracting

complex projects



---

I

Identity Fusion

Psychological attachment of self-worth to price or outcome.

PEP trains decoupling.


---

Invariant

Non-negotiable system constraint.

Examples:

Survival matters

Exit is allowed

Care continues



---

L

Life Maintenance Cost

Pro-rated cost of maintaining basic living conditions.

Included when:

work is primary income

no external support exists


Optional otherwise.


---

M

Mode (Operating Mode)

PEP supports three:

Unit Mode — per item
Hourly Mode — per hour
Hybrid Mode — per job/load

Mode determines how C is computed.


---

Market Signal

Aggregate response to pricing.

Used for calibration, not self-judgment.


---

N

Neutrality

Ability to accept “yes” or “no” without identity threat.

Key success metric.


---

P

PEP (Personal Exchange Protocol)

A system for:

pricing

negotiation

self-regulation

value calibration


Built on coherence, not optimization.


---

Pro-Rating

Allocating shared costs across units of work.

Used for:

rent

tools

subscriptions

training



---

R

Range-Based Pricing (RBP)

Pricing via bounded envelope instead of fixed point.

Core PEP mechanic.


---

Regulation

Nervous system stabilization.

PEP treats dysregulation as technical noise.


---

S

SBR (Stare–Breathe–Relax)

Reset protocol for restoring clarity.

Used before major decisions.


---

Scarcity Ghost

Internalized fear of lack driving underpricing.

Primary distortion source.


---

Sovereignty (PEP)

Capacity to regulate exchange without coercion or collapse.

Not independence. Competence.


---

T

Trust Gradient

Continuum of relationship reliability.

Used to modulate envelope placement.


---

U

Unit Cost Mode

Pricing per discrete output.

Best for crafts and goods.


---

V

Volitional Engine

Capacity to initiate action under uncertainty.

Supported by 51/49.


---

W

Withdrawal (Exit)

Right to leave unsustainable exchange without penalty.

Core safety feature.


---

51/49 Protocol

Decision heuristic:

When stuck between two viable options, choose one at 51% and execute.

Used to break paralysis.


---

±10 Calibration

Somatic tuning method:

Move valuation from −10 to +10, then locate stable midpoint.

Improves precision with repetition.


---

Summary Constraint

All terms in this glossary are:

operational

testable

revisable


No term requires belief.

All require feedback.
